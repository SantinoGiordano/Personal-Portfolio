    <h2>Who I am</h2>
<div id="description">
    I am an Elms College graduate of 2024, holding two degrees in the Bachelors of Science. One
    in Digital Media design, and the other in Computer Science. This website portfolio is a living document of my
    work and holds someof my biggest projects. Some projects are my final showcase works, others are personal projects 
    and client based projects. These include indesign, photoshop and illustrator files. Other works such as website
    based work will be linked in this portfolio.

    <h2>My Work</h2>

            <h2>What is Showcase</h2> Showcase was a course in college where you work on one project for the entire semester. Along
            with this there are small rules; there must be a theme, meaning, and individually to the works, other than
            that it’s pure creativity and ingenuity. Throughout the semester we work individually but we constantly
            consult our peers and colleagues for advice and support. Through this class you learn time sensitive matters
            on long term projects and short term deadlines.
            <h2>Showcase 2023</h2> As a Junior I took a showcase for the first time. Knowing I would take this class
            again as a senior I chose a more creative and artistic approach of drawing what phobias would look like if
            they were created in photoshop. The project as a whole was titled ”Be Not Afraid”, referencing the biblical
            word of the Angels, as they were terrifying to look at and had to assure people they were of good nature and
            intent. All of the work are originally ideas and drawings of real phobias.

            <h2>Showcase 2024</h2> As a senior in college I wanted to focus less on artistic work and more on a
            technical level. My whole purpose of the project was to produce “structural design”. The series of work was
            named StartUp art, and it focused on a demographic that always needs a logo, a website, or color palette,
            the world of start up companies. Each piece of work represents a fictional business with there own color
            pallet (shown by the colors hex code), font family, logo design and slogan. My main goal is to show
            structure in my work, so after conferring with colleagues and mentors I found the best approach was to make
            each piece of work uniform in Placement and design but not style. Secondly, the color of the work needed to
            speak directly to what it was selling, so a lot of focus went into; What is this business? What do they
            sell? And who do they sell to.
            <h2>New York Times reconstruction</h2>The New York Times reconstruction project was performed on Indesign.
            The Sunday morning of March 31 2024, I went out and got a copy of the New York Times, and started my
            reconstruction. By hand and eye I took a ruler and measured out all the dimensions, found the real images
            they used, and the exact font they used to create a one to one replica of the New York Times. This was
            definitely one of the harder projects I had ever worked on as it required a lot of time and focus, and a lot
            of little details. Misreading the ruler or typing the wrong keystroke could jeopardize the alignment of the whole project, it
            was the definition of measure twice cut once.
