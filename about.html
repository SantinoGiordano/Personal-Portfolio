        I am an Elms College graduate of 2024, holding two degrees in the Bachelors of Science. One
        in Digital Media design, and the other in Computer Science. This website portfolio is a living document of my
        work and holds someof my biggest projects. Some projects are my final showcase works, others are personal projects 
        and client based projects. These include indesign, photoshop and illustrator files. Other works such as website
         based work will be linked in this portfolio.
